This is a full-stack application about preserving and updating a family tree. Users of the app can see our family lineage, view biographies of each family member in the tree, see a timeline of important family events, and even view historic documents that are unique to our family history.

### _Technologies Used_
The application is built using PostgreSQL, C#.NET, React.js, and Redux.js. This repository is the frontend part of the application (click [here](https://github.com/alexrogers823/CfpgFamilyTree) for the backend).

### _Background / Motivation_
The idea for this project was conceived in August 2020. My grandmother was turning 100-years old in December of that year, and I wanted to give her and the family a gift that would be extremely beneficial and long-lasting to commemorate a historic milestone. A family tree had been previously created 10 years prior on a pen and paper, which was put on the wall of my grandmother's basement. Knowing that it needed to be upgraded and digitized, I began designing and building the application.

### _Objective_
The project aims to acheive the following:
- Allow for dynamic expansion and editing of family lineage
- Decentralize responsibility of editing so that each user of the app can make additions and edits
- Include biographical content of each family member to enhance and preserve our family history
